# GitHub Account Update Summary

## Issue Addressed
The repository was not visible on your GitHub account "shreyahande" because it was configured to use a different GitHub username.

## Changes Made

1. **Remote URL Updated**:
   - Previous URL: `https://github.com/shreya070123/Restaurant-management-delivery-system.git`
   - New URL: `https://github.com/shreyahande/Restaurant-management-delivery-system.git`

2. **Documentation Updated**:
   - `github_add_repository.md`: Updated with your correct GitHub username (shreyahande)
   - `push_to_github.bat`: Updated to use your correct GitHub username
   - `github_setup_summary.md`: Updated with your correct GitHub username

## Next Steps to Make Your Repository Visible

### Step 1: Create a New Repository on GitHub
1. Go to [GitHub.com](https://github.com/new)
2. Sign in with your username: `shreyahande`
3. Create a new repository named: `Restaurant-management-delivery-system`
4. Do NOT initialize with README, .gitignore, or license
5. Click "Create repository"

### Step 2: Push Your Repository to GitHub
1. Double-click the `push_to_github.bat` file in your project folder
2. When prompted:
   - Enter your GitHub username: `shreyahande`
   - For password: use a personal access token (not your regular GitHub password)

### Step 3: Verify Your Repository

2. Confirm that all your files are visible on GitHub

## Creating a Personal Access Token (if needed)
If you don't have a personal access token:

1. Go to GitHub.com → Settings → Developer settings → Personal access tokens → Generate new token
2. Give it a name (e.g., "Restaurant Management System")
3. Select scopes: at minimum, select "repo" for full repository access
4. Click "Generate token"
5. Copy the token immediately (you won't be able to see it again)
